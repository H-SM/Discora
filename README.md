<!-- # 🐺 Usage

Graphpathguru stands as a meticulously crafted, user-friendly application designed to provide an accessible platform for in-depth exploration and comprehension of algorithmic operations. Follow these simple steps to visualize your graphs:

1. **Go to Playground:** Elevate your exploration experience by launching the application in the dynamic "Playground" state, setting the stage for an engaging interactive journey.
2. **Add your nodes and edges:** Thoughtfully select nodes and your preferred application from the dropdown menu, establishing connections through edges. This visual representation brings to life intricate relationships within your chosen system.
3. **Add weights to your edges:** Deepen your analysis by assigning weights to edges, capturing nuanced connections. Initiate the visualization process to witness the real-time flow and impact of the selected algorithm on associated nodes.
4. **Visualize:** Once the graph is generated, click the "Visualize" button to look over how the graph wil behave over the selected algorithm.
5. **Result:** Upon completion, the application provides detailed findings based on the utilized algorithm, enriching your understanding of complex systems.

The application is offering a visually intuitive interface, the platform encompasses a diverse array of algorithms, granting users the flexibility to engage with various computational processes.

# 🤝🏼 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. You are free to modify it whatever way you want. Just clone and enjoy 🚀. **Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.**

## Instructions over how to Contribute.

**Step 1. Install Git/ Github in your system.** Fork the repository: This step creates a copy of the original repository under your GitHub account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/H-SM/Discora.git
cd Discora
```

**Step 2 . Create a new branch:** It's recommended to create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your changes separate from the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

**Step 3. Make and commit your changes:** Write your code or make the necessary modifications to the files in the repository. Once you're done, commit your changes with a meaningful message describing the changes you made.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my contribution"
```

**Step 4. Sync with the original repository:** Keep your forked repository in sync with the original repository to incorporate any recent changes made by other contributors.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/H-SM/Discora.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

**Step 5. Push your changes and create a pull request:** Push your branch with the committed changes to your forked repository. Then, create a pull request to propose your changes to the original repository.

```bash
git push origin my-branch
```

After pushing your changes, you can visit the original repository's page on GitHub or the respective hosting platform. From there, you can create a pull request by following the prompts.

*Note that these commands assume you're using HTTPS to clone and push to the repository. If you have set up SSH keys, you can use the SSH URL instead for cloning and pushing.*
